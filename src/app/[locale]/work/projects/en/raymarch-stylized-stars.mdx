## The Gist
Experimenting with some procedural effects but on shaders instead of geometry nodes.

## Details

Found a really neat effect that I wanted to emulate and the instructions were just cryptic enough that I had to make some adjustments.

It's byfar one of my favorite little effects and I've been trying to find places to stick it onto models wherever I can.
