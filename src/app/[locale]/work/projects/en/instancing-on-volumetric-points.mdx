## The Gist
Made my CPU have a small seizure just to see it have one. Ended up getting a really fun looking cloud of cubes.

## Details

I'd messed around with Geometry Nodes before, mostly to get an understanding of how to use Blender and double up with an aspect of 3D that I wasn't as familiar with.

This led to several experiments with Procedural Generation over a few weeks and eventually landed me on this particular bit of visual fun.

Essentially what's going on here is we're taking a simple shape like Default Cube and filling it with a bunch of points and then on each of those points we put a tinier Defaul Cube.

This is an excellent way to save money on heating this winter.
