## The Gist
Initially I wanted to play around more with that Hydra Renderer but I couldn't get it to work out. So I worked on getting this interesting effect I'd seen on Twitter built up for my own library of effects to use in future scenes. 

## Details
Super simple setup that uses Raycasting to measure out where to place colors.
